Hello everyone! I wrote a Flappy Bird game in Python.
I would like to see the assessment of other programmers about the quality of my implementation of this game.
!!! To start the game, you need to run the flappy_bird.py file
!!! Have a nice game...
 P.S. I used the Google Translator when translating, so there may be misprints.
